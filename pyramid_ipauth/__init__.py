    """An IP-based authentication policy for pyramid.

    This pyramid authentication policy assigns userid and/or effective
    principals based on the originating IP address of the request.

    You must specify a set of IP addresses against which to match, and may
    specify a userid and/or list of principals to apply.  For example, the
    following would authenticate all requests from the 192.168.0.* range as
    userid "myuser":

        IPAuthenticationPolicy(["192.168.0.0/24"], "myuser")

    The following would not authenticate as a particular userid, but would add
    "local" as an effective principal for the request (along with Everyone
    and Authenticated):

        IPAuthenticationPolicy(["127.0.0.0/24"], principals=["local"])

    By default this policy does not respect the X-Forwarded-For header since
    it can be easily spoofed.  If you want to respect X-Forwarded-For then you
    must specify a list of trusted proxies, and only forwarding declarations
    from these proxies will be respected:

        IPAuthenticationPolicy(["192.168.0.0/24"], "myuser",
                               proxies=["192.168.0.2"])
